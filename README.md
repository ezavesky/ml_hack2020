## How to Use the Notebooks

The format of this workshop is [interactive notebooks](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/why-we-use-jupyter-notebooks.html) executed in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).  This concept is tried and true, since early days of AT&T's internal [RCloud](http://rcloud.social/index.html), and is still a great way to have interactivity in almost any language.

We'll be using in-house compute, hosted by CMLP.
